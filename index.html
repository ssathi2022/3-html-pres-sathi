Preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of 2 million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment.  80% of the world population lives on less than $10 a day. </h2>

More than 750 million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water. 165 million children under the age 5 are stunted due to chronic malnutrition. </h2>

Children and teens are put to work to help their families instead of going to school. People in poverty cannot take part in all the oppurtunites life offers and feel obligated to stay quiet. This also affects all of us because as human beings, our wellbeing is connected to each other. We all need to grow equally and together. If not, we will drive ourselves into instability and conflicts. A better world is only built by bettering the lives of our world as a whole. </h2>
